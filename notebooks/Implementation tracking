New functionalities to check:

** save training results first before doing anything else! **

Function in utils.py:
    - plot_run_resuts -> works
    - plot_average_results --> works
    - save_average_results_plots --> works
    - plot_observation_action_history --> works
    - compute_confidence_invtervals --> works
    - plot_confidence_intervals --> works

Cells in execution_env_notebook:
    - environment generation with env_params dict
        --Y works
    - save training results dict including env_params, sigq_params, training_params, results_dict
        --> works
    - plot single training run results
        --> works
    - plot and save average training results
        --> works
    - plot single episode trajectory
        --> works
    - load training results including env_params, sigq_params, training_params, results_dict
        --> works
    - comuptation and display of test statistics + V_0^* in statistics 
        --> works


Still to write new:
    - plot average inventory trajectory in specific test run
    - action and inventory trajectory in test run for specific episode
    - plot average Q-value convergence in training
    - (optional: reward and inventory per episode in test run)

venv python version: 
- after changing directory name:
    As an addition to the accepted answer, be also aware that changing the 
    directory name where your venv is located causes using the default python
    and pip paths of your system, instead of using the venv one.
    --> delete venv and cerate anew with new directory name
