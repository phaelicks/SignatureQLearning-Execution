New functionalities to check:

** save training results first before doing anything else! **

Function in utils.py:
    - plot_run_resuts 
    - plot_average_results 
    - save_average_results 
    - plot_observation_action_history

Cells in execution_env_notebook:
    - environment generation with env_params dict
    - save training results dict including env_params, sigq_params, training_params, results_dict
    - plot single training results
    - plot and save average training results
    - plot single episode trajectory
    - load training results including env_params, sigq_params, training_params, results_dict
    - comuptation and display of test statistics 

Still to write new:
    - plot average inventory trajectory in specific test run
    - action and inventory trajectory in test run for specific episode
    - confidence intervals for rewards / terminal inventory in test runs
    - V_0^* in statistics 
    - plot average Q-value convergence in training
    - (optional: reward and inventory per episode in test run)
