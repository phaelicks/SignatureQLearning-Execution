# This file subsumes the file 'abides/requirements.txt', except for the 
# requirement 'ray[rllib]==1.7.0', which causes inconsistencies in depency 
# versions. Since 'ray[rllib]' is only required for the demo

# If you want to make use of functionalities in ABIDES that require 
# 'ray[rllib]', uncomment the requirement below and resolve incosistencies.
